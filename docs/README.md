## �� **Project Overview**

### **What is Snug & Kisses?**
Snug & Kisses is a comprehensive B2B healthcare platform that provides doula and childcare services through employer partnerships.

### **Business Model**
```yaml
Platform ↔ Employer ↔ Employee-Family
- Platform: Service infrastructure and contractor network
- Employers: Purchase benefit packages and manage employee access
- Employees: Access services through employer portal
- Contractors: Deliver services to employee families

```

### **Core Services**

- **Postpartum Doula Support** - Specialized postpartum care and support
- **Birth Doula Support** - Birth preparation and labor support
- **Backup Childcare/Sitter Services** - Emergency and scheduled childcare

## 🏗️ **Multi-Portal Architecture**

### **System Overview**

The platform is built on **Zoho Catalyst** using a modern serverless architecture with **four distinct portals**, each serving specific user types and business functions:

## **🎯 Key Changes from Your Current Approach:**

1. **Multi-Portal Structure** - Clearly shows 4 separate portals
2. **Portal-Specific Features** - Each portal has distinct functionality
3. **Role-Based Access Matrix** - Clear permissions per user type
4. **Development Server Setup** - Each portal runs on different ports
5. **Portal Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of the system

This README now properly reflects your **multi-portal healthcare platform** architecture instead of a single client approach. It shows the complexity and sophistication of your system while maintaining clarity for developers and stakeholders.

Would you like me to help you create this README file and start implementing the multi-portal structure?
