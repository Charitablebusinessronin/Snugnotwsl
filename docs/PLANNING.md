### **Image Usage in React Components:**

#### **1. Public Images (Recommended for Static Assets):**
```jsx
// In your React components, reference public images like this:
<img src="/images/logo/snug-logo-primary.png" alt="Snug & Kisses Logo" />
<img src="/images/healthcare/doula-services/prenatal-care.jpg" alt="Prenatal Care Services" />
<img src="/images/ui/icons/healthcare/doula-icon.svg" alt="Doula Services" />
<img src="/images/users/avatars/default-avatar.png" alt="User Avatar" />
```

#### **2. Benefits of Public Images:**
- ✅ **Immediately accessible** via direct URL
- ✅ **No build process** required
- ✅ **Fast loading** for static assets
- ✅ **Easy to reference** in HTML and CSS
- ✅ **Follows official Catalyst standards**

### **Implementation Steps:**

#### **1. Create the Image Directory Structure:**
```bash
# Navigate to your client directory
cd client

# Create the main images directory
mkdir -p public/images

# Create subdirectories for organization
mkdir -p public/images/{logo,healthcare,ui,users,marketing}

# Create healthcare service subdirectories
mkdir -p public/images/healthcare/{doula-services,childcare-services,family-support,wellness}

# Create UI subdirectories
mkdir -p public/images/ui/{icons,backgrounds,buttons,placeholders}

# Create icon subdirectories
mkdir -p public/images/ui/icons/{navigation,healthcare,common}

# Create user subdirectories
mkdir -p public/images/users/{avatars,profiles,testimonials}

# Create marketing subdirectories
